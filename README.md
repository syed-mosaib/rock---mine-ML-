# rock---mine-ML-
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying rocks and sonar returns using various algorithms. The goal of this project is to develop a robust model capable of accurately distinguishing between rocks and sonar signals based on the provided dataset.

# Project Overview
The "Rock and Sonar Classification" project is a supervised machine learning task where the objective is to classify objects as either rocks or mines (sonar returns) using their attribute measurements. This classification task is particularly important in fields such as underwater exploration and military applications, where distinguishing between these objects can be critical.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks Data Set" available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 208 samples, each with 60 features representing the energy of sonar signals at various frequencies. Each sample is labeled as either "R" for rock or "M" for mine.

Number of Instances: 208
Number of Attributes: 60 (continuous values)
Class Labels: "R" (Rock) or "M" (Mine)
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset and any data-related scripts.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
src/: Source code for the machine learning models and utilities.
models/: Saved models and evaluation results.
reports/: Project reports and documentation.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Visualization: Plotting confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importances.
